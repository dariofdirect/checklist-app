# checklist-app
I will be creating a checklist web application. Powered by JS, its some HTML and Css


First we will be creating the HTML and CSS.
Css was copied from 'themaxsendelin' on GitHub. He used a CSS template he created i thought was very useful.

Then we'll be updating the Javascript to  make the app functional.
